                <p><b> SWAT VALLEY </b>Though it has had a rough past, the present and future of Swat Valley are shining very
                    bright. This stunning valley in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan is something straight
                    out of a fairy tale.

                    Think bright green fields and forests, picturesque villages, and rivers boasting shades of blue so
                    clear and bright you wouldnâ€™t have thought them real!</p>
